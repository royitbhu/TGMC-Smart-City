<p align="justify">
Banaras Hindu University is an internationally reputed temple of learning, situated 
in the holy city of Varanasi. This creative and innovative University was founded by 
the great nationalist leader, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, in 1916 with the 
cooperation of great personalities like Dr. Annie Besent, who viewed it as the 
University of India. Banaras Hindu University was created under the Parliamentary 
Legislation-B.H.U. Act, 1915. It played a stellar role in the independence movement 
and has developed into the greatest centre of learning in India. It has produced 
many great freedom fighters and builders of modern India and has immensely 
contributed to the progress of the nation through a large number of renowned 
scholars, artists, scientists and technologists who have graced its portals.<br><br>
Banaras Hindu University ranks among the first few in the country in the field of 
academic and research output. This university has  two campuses, 3 institutes, 
16 faculties, 140 departments, 4 advanced centers and 4 interdisciplinary schools. 
The University is making its mark at the national and international levels in a 
number of frontier areas of Science, Social Science, Technology, Medicine and 
Agriculture etc.<br><br>
A university can grow successfully only when research and teaching mesh together 
seamlessly - one without the other is incomplete. Therefore we have ensured the 
development of a collaborative environment conducive to learning, exposure to the 
best international practices and promotion of innovation and creativity.<br><br>
BHU today has nearly twenty thousand students including 2500 research scholars and 
650 foreign students from 34 nations, under one roof who are pursuing different 
academic programmes at this campus as well as the newly established Rajiv Gandhi 
South Campus. These are some of the brightest young minds in the country and abroad, 
who have joined this University after clearing a rigorous All India Entrance Test.
<br><br>
We realize that the rapid pace of development in the country has raised the awareness 
as well as expectations of the people. Institutions of higher learning are 
instrumental in providing equality of opportunities, which is the essence 
of participatory democracy. This will not only remove a sense of alienation 
and neglect in the backward regions but also prevent out migration from these areas.
<br><br>BHU has established the Rajiv Gandhi South Campus at Barkachha about 75 Kms 
southwest of Varanasi on 2760 acres of land.  The first academic session commenced 
from 2006-07 with six programmes which has increased to more than 25 in the present 
session. This campus is emerging as a potential hub to impart education, training 
and entrepreneurship development skills, to the youth, women and marginalized 
sections of society in the backward region of Mirzapur and adjoining districts of 
Uttar Pradesh, Western Bihar and Northern Madhya Pradesh. The Campus is heading 
well as per your vision for education to generate new breed of human resource who 
would be job creators and not job seekers.</p>
