        temple was demolished by the order of Aurangazed and concerted into a mosque (still serves

        the Dhupapapa, among which only the first one is visible and rest are vanished, or assumed
        in the form of manifestation. The merit and glory of this ghat are described in an
        eleventh century text and also in the KKh (59;116-144). This was the chief resort of a
        great teacher of Vadanta, Ramananda (CF 1299-1411) to whom Kabira (1398-1623) a great
        reformist bhakit poet, accepted as guru. Ramananda's monastery is still there. Tulsi
        (1547-1623) was initially living (c.1580s-1590s) at this ghat where he composed the famous
        writing, the Vindu-patrika (&quot;The petition to Rama&quot;), describing the glory of
        Vindu Madhava temple (VP 61-63,see allchin 1966;129-132, compare KKh 60,61). </font></strong></p>

        in 1580 by Raghunatha Tandan (Todara Mala?), the finance secretary of the Mughal King
        Akbar. In c. 1735 Bajirao Pesava-I together with Sadasive Naik rebuilt and repaired it.
        Again in 1775 renovations and repairing were done by Sripatirao Pesava, and Pant
        Pririnidhi of Andha. There are eight water-front sacred tirthas at the ghat: Pippalada,
        Vindu Makha, Mayukharka, Jnanahrda and Pancanada. There are two monasteries at the ghat,

        number, afford accommodation to a multitude of worshippers and bathers. The turrets are
        low and hollow, and are employed as temples and shrines. Each one contains several
        deities, which are, mostly, emblems of Siva. An ordinary observer would be in ignorance of
        the fact these are filled with idols, and would scarely imagine that he was walking upon
        the top of a long succession of shrines, and over the heads of hundreds of gods. He would
        have to descend several steps, before discovering the sacrilege which he was ignorantly
        committing; but having done so, he would at once perceive that the turrets are open
        towards the river, and are, therefore, very convenient for devotional purposes&quot;. </font></strong></p>

        bathing are performed here on the birthday of the Ganga,i.e. Vaisakha (Apr.-May), on the

        ancestors, arranged in the sky with the bamboo stands, is performed by the ghatiyas
        (ghat-triests) on behalf of the devotees who patronize the cost, or materials and rewards

        them. This sacred spot is fully eulogized in the MP (185-68), the VP (3.34-50), the KKh
        (84.109; see also 51.44-82). This was the most favourite holy site of the Gahadavala
        kings, as evident from the Gahadavala inscription that&quot; a great number of regal
        ritual occasions in Varanasi included the worship of Adi Kesava or a dip in the Ganga at
        the Varana confluence: (Niyogi 1959: app. B as in Eck 1982:233). The ghat was made pucca
        in 1790 by a Divan of Scindhia State.</font></strong></p>

        thighs; and Adi Kesava is the feet&quot; (Eck 1982:233). This reminds that Vianu first
        placed his holy feet here in Varanasi. His foot prints (Carana Paduka) in the Adi Kesava
