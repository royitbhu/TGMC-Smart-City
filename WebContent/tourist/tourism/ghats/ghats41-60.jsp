        ancient most referred ghat. According to the myth related to Divodasa, Lord Brahma (&quot;
        the creator&quot; in the Hind trinity gods) performed the ten-horses sacrifice
        (dasa-asvamedha) at this site. The historical sources infer that at this site the
        revivalist Hindu dynasty of the second century, the Bhara Siva Nagas had performed
        ten-horses sacrifice. The KKh (52.1-10:61.38) records many verses describing glory of this
        ghat. The temple of Sulatankesvara, Brahmesvara, Varahesvara, Abhaya Vinayaka, the Ganga
        (&quot;goddess&quot;), and Bandi Devi are closeby at the top of the ghat. These shrines

        the confluence of the Ganga, the Yamuna and the invisible Sarasvati rivers. It is commonly
        believed that doing rituals and taking sacred bath here provide exactly the same religious
        merit as those at Prayaga (80 km away in the west). The merit of this ares is eulogized in
        the KKh (61.36-38). About the present condition, Eck (1982.228) remarks that &quot;Today,
        however, the name Prayaga Ghat, while it is painted boldly on temple that sits between the
        two branches of Dasasvamedha, is not commonly used. And even the temple there is utterly
        defunct, used only by boatmen who store their gear in its sanctum&quot;. The temple and
        the ghat-area were reconstructed by queen of Digpatia state (West Bengal). For the whole

        Siva gives Taraka mantra ( &quot;Prayer of the crossing&quot;) in the ear of the dead,
        therefore the form of Siva as Tarakesvara, (the temple is at the ghat), is propitiated

        Siva dyring His transcendental dance here. The historical sources mention this site in the
        Gupta inscriptions of C.E.4<sup>th</sup> century. This is the first ghat made pucca by the
        two king brothers in C.E.1302; and was rebuilt and repaired in 1730 under the patronage of

        Bhagiratha, the Cakra-Puskarini Kunda was present. Says the KKh(60.137-138) . For the
