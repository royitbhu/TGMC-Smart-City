     Sarnath renowned for ancient remains of Bhuddhist stupas, monasteries and temples, is situated at a distance of 6 kms. to the
     north of Varanasi city witch is well connected by road, rail and air.<img src="../../images/history/RuinsofSarnath.jpg" width="313" height="213" alt="DHAMEKH STUPA" align="right" border="1"></img>

      <br/><li> Sarnath is one of the four most important Bhuddhist pilgrimage centres of India. Bhudda, the great  
      sage, after attaining enlightenment (Bhudda-hood) at BodhGaya came to Sarnath and  elivered his first sermon to 
		five disciples (i.e.   Kaundinya, Bashpa, Bhadrika, Mahanaman and Ashvajit) for redeeming humanity. It is this place where foundation of a new order of monks (Sangha) and  a 
   new order of religious doctrine (Dhamma) was laid. Sarnath is also sacred to the Jains because they look upon it as the site of asceticism and death of Shreyamshanath, the 11<sup>th</sup>
        Trithankara. </li>    
      <br/><li>
       In ancient Bhuddhist literature
		the
      place  
      finds  
      mention  
      as  
      Rishipatna  
      and  
      Mrigdava
      or Mrigadaya. The place was called Rishipatna , as it
        was here the bodies of five hundred Pratyeka Bhuddhas or Rishis(Sages) fell after their
        attainment of nirvana (Salvation). According to the Jataka, in one of his previous births
        Bhudha as aleader of a herd of deer,for saving life of a doe, appeared before the king of
        Benaras who relished on the flesh of a deer everyday. On being moved by his sacrifical
        zeal the king made the place a free roaming ground, thus it was known as mrigadava
        (deerpark). The inscriptions of early medieval period found from Sarnath referred to this
        place as Dharamchakra or Sadhamacharka pravartana vihar. The mordern name Sarnath seems to
        be a contraction of Saranganath (Lord of deer) still borne by the Lord Shiva enshrined in
        a temple nearby. </li>

		Sarnath pased into oblivion in the 13<sup>th</sup>
        cent. and veil was lifted in 1798 when Mr. Duncan , the resident of Benaras gave an
        account of a casket of green marble inside a stone box exposed by the workmen of Jagat
        Singh, Dewan of Raja Chet Singh of Benaras while dismantling the Dharmaralika stupa in
        order to procure building materials. This discovery had created wide interest about
        Sarnath.  </li>
    
     
      <br/><li> Later on excanvations were conducted at the site by
        Sir Alexander Cunningham (1835-36), Major Kittoe (1851-52), Mr.C. Horne (1865), Mr. F.O.
        Oertal (1904-5), Sir john Marshall (1907), Mr. H. Hargreaves(1914-15), and Mr. Daya Ram
        Sahni (1927-32). </li>
     
     
      <br/><li> Archaeological excavations have brought to light
        about a dozen carved railing pillars ascribable to the Shunga period (2<sup>nd</sup>-1st cent. B.C.). </li>
      <p align="center"><b><a href="history_sarnath.jsp#TOP">TOP</a></b> </p>
     
      <br/><li> With the advent of the Kushana (1<sup>st</sup>
        - 2<sup>nd</sup> cent. A.D.) in north India Bhuddhism witnessed a new phase of
        Religious and artistic activities.
      Though Mathura was the centre of this renaissance, but
      Sarnath also flourished and new monuments were raised. The colossal image of Bodhisattva
        imported form Mathura in the 3<sup>rd</sup> regnal year of Kanishka is now exhibited in
        the museum. </li>
     
     
      <br/><li> During the Gupta period (4<sup>th</sup>-6<sup>th</sup>
        century A.D.). Sarnath became a main centre of structural and artistic activities. Several structures including Mulgandhakuti, the chief shrine of
        the Buddha were erected during this period. The Dhamekh stupa is the best preserved and
        most impressive edifice at Sarnath. It is a cylindrical tower 28.50 mts. In diameter at
        base and 33.53 mts. In height. Fa-Hien the Chinese pilgrim visited Sarnath at the time of
        Chandragupta ll (376-414 A.D.) and saw here four stupas and two monastteries. </li>
     <img src="../../images/history/Sarnath_Lion_Capital_of_Ashoka.jpg" width="223" height="313" alt="LION CAPITAL" align="right" border="1"> 
     
      <br/><li> The reign stupas and Harshavardhan (606-47 A.D.)
        must have initiated fresh religious activity and restorations of the earlier building at
        Sarnath. Hiuen-Tsang visited Sarnath during the time and left a vivid descriptinued of its
        monuments. </li>
     
     
      <br/><li> This place continued to flourish during the reign of
        the pala kings. But the monuments of Sarnath experienced a reverse, when Benaras suffered
        under the spearhead of Mahmud Ghajni's invasion which is inferred from a record of
        the time of Mahilala, datable to 1026 A.D. </li>
     
     
      <br/><li> Kumar Devi, wife of Govindchandra (1114-1154 A.D.) of the Gahadavala dynasty built a large monastery at Sarnath which is probably the last
        impressive monuments raised here and after which the architectural and artistic activitivs
        came to a halt. The glorious heritage remained hidden for a larger period and waited for
        the archaeological spade to uncover it. </li>

      <br/><li> Sarnath is situated some four miles north of
        Benares, not far from the high road to Ghazipur .. A more direct route, of which traces
        are still extant, seems formerly to have connected the city with Sarnath . Starting from
        the centre of Benares near the Pachganga-ghat, where Aurangzeb's mosque forms' a
        conspicuous landmark, this road led due north past Lat Bhairon and crossed the
      Varna river
        at Purana Pul by a bridge, Some remains of which can still be seen a little distance above
        the viaduct of the mertre-gauge railway to Ghazipur. At the end of the eighteenth century
        a ruined Mughal bridge of three spans occupied the site. As the nearer abutment had been
        damaged by floods Mr. Jonathan Duncan, the then Resident of Benares had the bridge
        dismantled and used the stone for a new bridge over the same river near the present Bank
        of Bengal. Some further materials for Duncan's bridge, as we shall see later on, were
        obtained from the ruthless spoliation of the ancient Sarnath building.  </li>
     
     
      <br/><li> In the earliest period of which we have any record
        Sarnath was known as the "  deer Park"  (Mriga-Dava) or "  Above of
        sages"  (Rishipatana). It plays a prominent part in one of the Jataka or birth stories
        of the Buddha, the legend, as generally accepted, being as follows:--In one of his
        previous existences (Nigrodha-Miga-Jataka)the Buddha roamed the wood near Benares as the
        king of a heard of deer. The Raja of Banares, who
      was
      fond of sport, had
      slaughtered
      so many
        deer that the king of the deer demonstrated with him and offered to furnish him with one
        deer daily throughout the year if he would give up slaughtering them for sport. The Raja
        consented. After some time, when it came to the turn of a hind, big with young, to be
        presented to the Raja, she objected that, although if might be her turn to die, yet the
        turn of her little one could not yet have arrived. The king of the deer (that is, the
        future Buddha)was struck with compassion, and offered himself to the Raja in place of the
        bind. On hearing the story the Raja exclaimed:"   I am but a deer in the form of a man,
        but you are a man in the form of a deer:"   He at once gave up hiss claim to the daily
        gift, and made over the park for the perpetual use of the deer, on which account it was
        called the "  Deer Park."    </li>
     
     
      <br/><li>At the time of Buddha the Deer Park presumably was a
        favorite resort for those engaged in religious devotions. At least the story goes that
        Ajnata Kaundinya and the other four early attendants of the Buddha retired there for
        meditatioin after forsaking their master in Uravilva. However this may have been, the Deer
        Park early became celebrated among the followers of the Buddha  for it was here that the
        master first made known his doctrines to the world, and the spot where on he sat and
        preached has ever been revered as holy ground by the Buddhists.  </li>
     
     <p align="center"><b><a href="history_sarnath.jsp#TOP">TOP</a></b> </p>
      <br/><li> Practically all that we know of
        Sarnath up to the fifth century of our era is derived from the monuments that
      have been
        unearthed there, and will be recounted below. From the fifth century on wards we possess
        much other information furnished by the in valuable accounts of Chinese pilgrims to India,
        Particularly by those of Fa-Hien and Hiuen Thsang, the former of whom visited the site in
        the beginning of the fifth century, the later between the year 629 and 645 A.D.
        Fa-Hien's chronicle is very concise. "  Rather more,"   He says, " than ten
        li to the north-east of the city, he found the vihara in the park of the
        'Rishi's Deer-wild.' In this park there formerly resided the Pratyeka
        Buddha, with whom the deer were regularly in the habit of stopping for the night. When The
        world-honored one was about to attain to perfect Wisdom, the divas sang in the sky
        'The son of king Suddhodana, having quitted his family and studied the Path (of
        Wisdom) will now in seven days become Buddha. The Pratyeka Buddha heard their words, and
        immediately attained to Nirvana; and hence this place was named 'The Park of the
        Rishi's Deer-wild.' After the world-honored one had attained to perfect Wisdom,
        men built the vihara in it." ; Fa-Hien tells us, further, of Buddha's meeting with
        Kaundinya and his four companions in the Park, and speaks of four topes which he
        saw - one to mark the spot where the five companions rose to salute the Buddha; a
        second where the master " ;turned the wheel of the Law ..." ; a third where he
        delivered his prophecy concerning Maitreya; and a fourth where a certain naga, named
        Elapattra, questioned him. Fa-Hien also mentions two monasteries as existing in the Deer
        Park.. Hiuen Thsang's description is much fuller than his predecessor's and no
        doubt, in his day the buildings in the Deer Park were far more numerous and splendid, and
        the number of bhikshus far greater than when Fa-Hien visited it. We shall have to refer so
        frequently in the following pages to Hiuen Thsang, that it will be as wel at the outset to
        quote his description at some length." ;To the north-east" ; he says, " ;of the
        river Varana, about ten li or so, we came to the sangharama of Lu-ye (stag Desert). Its
        precincts are ivied into eight portions(sections) connected by a surrounding wall. The
        storeyed towers with projecting eaves and the balconies are of very superior work. There
        are fifteen hundred priests in this convent who study the little vehicle according to the
        sammatiya school. In the great enclosure is a Vihara about 200 feet high; above the roof
        is a golden covered figure of the Amra (An-mo-lo) or mango fruit. The foundations of the
        building are of stone, and the stairs also: but the towers and niches are of brick. The
        niches are arranged on the four sides in a hundred successive lines, and in each niche is
        a golden figure of Buddha. In the middle of the Vicar is a figure of Buddha made of
        teou-shin (native copper). It is the size of life, and he is represented as turning the
        wheel of the law (preaching). To the south west of the vihara is a stone stupa buillt by
        Asoka-raja. Although the foundations have given way, there are still 100 feet or more of
        the wall remaining. In front of the building is a stone pillar about 70 feet high. The
        stone is altogether as bright as jade. It is glistening and sparkles like light; and all
        those who pray fervently before it see from time to time, according to their petitions,
        figures with good or bad signs. It was here that Tathagata (ju-lai), having arrived at
        enlightenment , began to turn the wheel of the law (to preach)." ; </p>
      </li><p align="center"><b><a href="history_sarnath.jsp#TOP">TOP</a></b> </p>
      <br/><li> After mentioning a multitude of
        other stupas and memorials Hiuen Thsang speaks of three lakes to the west and north of the
        monastery, and of a number of other monuments outside it, and then proceeds to describe
        the most magnificent stupa of all, 2or 3 <i>li </i>to the south-west of the sangharama.
        This stup was about 300 feet high. " ;The foundations," ; he states, " ;are broad
        and the building high, and adorned with all sorts of carved work and with precious stages
        (to this building) with niches and although there is a standing pole erected above the
        cupola (fau-poh), yet it has no encircling bells. </p>
      </li>
      <br/><li> For how long after Hiuen
        Thsang's visit Sarnath continued to flourish is not definitely known, but the
        evidence of monuments and inscriptions proves that it was still thriving at least in the
        twelfth century A. D. and it is probable that it owed its downfall to the iconoclastic
        Moslems under Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who devastated Benares in 1194 A.D.; for the condition of
        the excavated ruins proves that a violent catastrophe, accompanied by willful destruction
        and plunder, overtook the place. Certain it is that after the overthrow of Buddhism in
        India Sarnath was completely deserted and all its buildings, with the exception of one
        magnificent stupa, became buried in the heaps of their own accumulated debris. Indeed, so
        completely leveled did the site become that is was only a fortuitous discovery at the
        close of the 18<sup>th</sup> century that drew the attention of archaeologists to it and
        subsequently led to its exploration. But before proceeding to narrate the history of this
        exploration, it will be conferment to describe in detail the stupa already referred to.  </p>
      </li>
      <br/><li>Locally known as the Dhamekh
        tower, this stupa is situated a little to the north-east of the modern Jain temple. It
        consists of a stone basement, 93 feet in diameter and solidly built, the stones being
        clamped together with iron, to the height of 43 feet Above that it is in brickwork rising
        to a height of 104 feet above the terrace of the temple, and 143 feet including its
        foundation. Externally the lower part is relieved by eight projecting faces, each 21 feet
        6 inches wide and 15 feet apart. In each is a small niche, intended, apparently, to
        contain an image, and below them, encircling the monument, is a band of sculptured
        ornament of the most exquisite beauty. The central part of this band consists of geometric
        patterns of great intricacy, but combined with singular skill, while above and below are
        rich floralarabesques, the whole being peculiarly characteristic of the art of the
        imperial Guptas. The carvings round the niches end in the projections have been left
        unfinished, and judging by the absence of any fragments, either in stone or brick or
        plaster around the stup, it seems not improbable that the upper part of the tower was
        never completed. </p>
      </li><p align="center"><b><a href="history_sarnath.jsp#TOP">TOP</a></b> </p>
      <br/><li> In his examination of this tower
        General Cunningham found, buried in the brickwork, an inscribed stone with the Buddhist
        formula " ;Ya dharmma hetupra-bhava, etc. said to be in characters of the seventh
        century : and there can be little doubt that this record is contemporary with the last
        with the last rebuilding of the stupa. It is noteworthy also that General Cunningham found
        that at a depth of 110 feet from the top the stonework gave place to brickwork made of
        very large bricks, such as are commonly employed in the earliest class of structures in
        India, and there is every reason to believe that this lowest stratum of brickwork,
        represents the first stupa on this spot which was afterwards builds over and enlarged to
        the dimensions which we now see. To return, however, to the discovery referred to above.
        In 1794 some workmen of Jagat Singh, the Diwan of Raja Chet Singh of Benares, were digging
        for bricks on the site of Sarnath when they accidentally struck upon the treasure chamber
        of large brick stupa with a heavy stone box inside, which they proceeded to rifle of its
        contents. green marble casket with a few charred bones, pearls, rubies and gold leaves
        found its way into the hands of Mr. Jonathan Duncan. The inner marble casket has
        disappeared, but the outer stone box was left in its original position, where it was
        rediscovered by Sir Alexander Cunningham in 1835. He sent it to the Bengal Asiatic
        Society, and it is now in the Indian Museum at Calcutta. A Buddha image which was
        discovered on the same occasion but not apparently in the relic chamber, was recovered, in
        1849, by Major Kit toe,. Only the broken base of it is left, but fortunately the
        inscription, which is very important, is still legible. This fragment and several other
        sculptures originally collected by Major Kit toe at the Queen's college, in Benaras ,have
        now found their way to the Lucknow Provincial Museum. </p>
      </li>
      <br/><li> The monument where these
        discoveries were made has since been known at the Jagat Singh stupa, and the this title we
        may still continue to designate it. It is nothing more than a more shell, all the core
        having been removed. This shell consists of concentric rings of brickwork laid in clay and
        faced with plaster, which mark the successive periods at which the stupa was enlarged. The
        innermost existing ring has a diameter of 44'3" ; , but it is impossible to say
        whether or not there were other and smaller rings inside it, or whether the whole of the
        core that has been demolished represented the original stupa. It is noticeable that the
        outer terrace, surrounding each successive ring, is higher than that of the preceding one.
        This fact is easily accounted for when one remembers that in process of time, as ring
        after ring was added to the stupa, the ground around rose and the floors of the later
        structures would thus be considerably above the original floor level.  </p>
      </li>
      <br/><li> Following on the discovery of the
        Jagat Singh stupa Sarnath became a favorite hunting-ground for treasure-seekers, and
        cartloads of images and terra-cottas are said to have been carried away. The first
        excavations, however, of which we have any record were those carried out by Colonel C.
        Mackenzie in 1815. The next explorer on the scene was General Cunningham, who, in 1835-36,
        unearthed a monastery and shrine of a late period on the high ground rather less than a
        hundred yards north-east of the Jagat Singh stupa, and a few feet, north of the latter a
        large collection of statues and bas-reliefs, which he presented to the Asiatic Society of
        Bengal. Twelve years later the work of exploration was taken up by Major M. Kit toe, who
        was than holding the position of " ;Archaeological Enquirer" ; to Government. Major
        Kit toe exposed the foundations of numerous stupas and shrines around the Dhamekh tower,
        besides a building to the west of the tower, which he called hospital, but which was no
        doubt a monastery, and a second monastery west of the Jain temple. Unfortunately for
        archaeology Major Kit toe died before publishing an account of his discoveries, and all
        his notes and memoranda have been lost though a large volume of his drawings is still
        extant in the India office library. Muchof the stonework excavated by Major Kit toe was
        used by him in the erection of the Queen's College at Benares, but all the more
        important sculptures and carvings were collected together at the college, whence they were
        afterwards transferred to the Lucknow provincial Museum or returned to Sarnath. Major
        Kittoe's excavations of the monastery west of the Jain temple were resumed in 1853 by
        Mr. E. Thomas, and afterwards by Dr. F.Hall of Queen's College, who collected
        numerous sculptures and small objects, a number of which are to be found at the Sarnath
        museum. Dr. Butter obtained permission to continue Dr. hall's work, but, if he did
        so, no account of his operations survives. About 1865 Mr.C.Horne did some vicarious
        dogging at Sarnath and send his finds to the Indian Museum, Calcutta. Lastly, we hear of
        Mr. Rivett Carnao digging up a Buddha image at Sarnath in 1877, but what became of it is
        not known. </p>
