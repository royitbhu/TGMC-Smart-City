      <li>In 1959, a mass exodus of the Tibetan emigrants left their country and took 
		political asylum in India. Under the active consideration of the fourteenth Dalai Lama H.H
    	Tenzin Gyatso and India's then Prim Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the 
		present institute in was established in 1967 with a view to educating 
		the youths of Tibet and the students on the Indian border who had lost the 
		opportunity of living in Tibet for advanced studies and religious discourses 
		in Buddhism which had been their natural milieu. A more important reason for 
		the establishment of Institute was to resuscitate the past glory which lies
        ensconced in the precious Buddhist scriptures on religion and philosophy, art and
        architecture and science and technology_ including astronomy and medicine, a 
		substantial volume of which is preserved by the Tibetan exiles despite their 
		sudden and terrific calamity.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The Institute has been established with the ethos of imparting education in Tibetan
        Studies with a predilection for the traditional Tibetan method of teaching within an
        innovative framework of modern universities comprising time-bound courses of study,
        written examinations and award of degrees. The Institute is mainly research-oriented and
        seeks to mould through its teaching departments students turning into suitably qualified
        persons capable of undertaking works of research and restitution in concurrence with the
        fundamental objectives of the organization. With this purpose, the syllabuses of courses
        have been so drawn as to provide the students with sound footings in traditional subjects
        of Tibetology, while enabling them at the same time, to be fully conversant with modern
        subjects and research methodology.</font></li>
    </ul>
        
     <ul>
      <li>Before the declaration of the Deemed to be University status, the organizational set up
        of the Institute was suitably amended as desired by the University Grants Commission and
        the Department of Culture. Now, the Institute's management is the Society headed by Prof.
        K. Satchidananda Murty as its Chairman, nominated by Government of India and the Board of
        Governors headed by Prof. S. Rinpoche, the Director of the Institute. Both these bodies
        consist of eminent scholars nominated by Government of India, nominees of H.H. the Dalai
        Lama, representatives of various ministries, University Grants Commission and faculty
        members of the Institute. These bodies are further assisted by the Academic Council, the
        Finance Committee, the Planning and Monitoring Board and other auxiliary bodies and
        committees.</li>
    </ul>
 <ul>
      <li>The Institute formerly functioned as a special constituent wing of the Sampurnananda
        Sanskrit University, Varanasi. The work of the Institute was reviewed by the Chandramani
        Review Committee in 1970 and the D.P.Yadav Committee in 1975. In view of the pragmatic 
		sanction and desirability of its avowed growth, the Review Committees recommended that the
        Institute may be given an independent status and be shifted to Sarnath. Accordingly, the
        Institute was registered under the Societies Registration Act in the end of 1977 to
        operate as an autonomous organization under the Department of Culture, Ministry of
        Education, Government of India with 100% financial support from the Government. Since then
        the Institute has steadily progressed with optimal success. After considerable growth of
        its infrastructure and academic excellence, the Department of Culture initiated a proposal
        for this Institute during 1983-84 to have the Deemed to be University Status. After a
        careful consideration at both the University Grants Commission and Central Government
        levels, the Institute was finally declared as a &quot;Deemed to be University&quot; on 5th
        April,1988.</li>
